The primary goal of the "OWASP Low-Code/No-Code Top 10" document is to provide assistance and education for organizations looking to adopt and develop Low-Code/No-Code applications. The guide provides information about what the most prominent security risks are for such applications, the challenges involved, and how to overcome them.
